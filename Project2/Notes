Must change between Realms
Every realm has a unique charm

If you change your charm to that of another realm you will vanish from this realm and you will be born in the other

Change charm: magi of different powers that can use their incantation to change the charm carved into your soul

Each incantation can either add a symbol, remove a symbol or change a symbol to another in your charm

Greater power: If any magus uses their incantation on your charm, only magi of greater power than the previous magus can change your charm.

Gems for help: The magi will ask you for a quantity of gems equal to their power, and if you provide them with the gems they will use their incantation of your charm.

Find magis: In each realm in which you are born or reborn, you will meet a magus on each of your birthdays


Mitra sighed and continued: “So remember Kael’zak, on each realm you are going to meet a magus every year. Each magus can use their incantation to either add a symbol, remove a symbol or change a symbol in your charm. If a magus changes your charm in a realm, only magi of greater power will be able to change it while you are in that same realm. Each magus will ask for a number of gems equal to their power if you want them to change your charm.”
She then said: “Now I will give you the charm for all of the realms, and I will also tell you the power of the magi that you would meet in each realm in the order that they would meet you, if you were reborn in those realms. I will also tell you the charm for the realm to which you need to deliver the message. You have to find the way with the least number of incantations needed to reach that realm, and also the way back from there to this realm. For each way, you have to tell me the least number of incantations needed, and the number of gems you will need throughout the way.”
